## Tools & Technologies Used:

- **SwiftUI**: The core framework used to build the app's user interface.
  
- **ScrollView & ScrollViewReader**: Used for creating scrollable content and programmatically controlling scroll position. This combination is essential to achieve the animated sticky header effect.

- **GeometryReader**: Utilized to create the dynamic resizing effect of the header based on the scroll position.

- **TabView**: Provides a tab-based navigation for the app allowing seamless switching between different views.

- **Custom Modifiers**: Introduced custom SwiftUI modifiers, like `ScrollDetector`, to handle specific layout and behavior.

- **Xcode**: The primary IDE for developing, testing, and debugging the application.

## Features:

- **Animated Sticky Header**: As users scroll through content, the header resizes to a smaller version, sticking to the top. Scrolling back returns it to its original size.

- **Tab-based Content Navigation**: Users can seamlessly navigate between posts, collections, and likes via intuitive tabs.

- **Dynamic User Interface**: The interface adjusts gracefully across different device sizes and orientations, making for a pleasant user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated:

1. **Advanced SwiftUI Techniques**: Demonstrated a deep understanding of SwiftUI views, modifiers, and layout systems, especially in creating complex animations and interactions like the resizable header.

2. **Dynamic Layouts**: Skillfully adapted views according to different device sizes and safe areas.

3. **Custom Interactions & Animations**: Implemented custom interactions, like special scroll behaviors and the animated header, to enhance the user experience.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensured the app runs smoothly by optimizing list rendering and scroll performance.

5. **Code Organization**: Maintained a modular and clean codebase, separating different views and functionalities into respective structs and ensuring reusability.

6. **UI/UX Design**: Crafted a visually appealing interface ensuring intuitive user navigation and interaction.
